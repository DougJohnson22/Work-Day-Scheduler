# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Welcome to your Work Day Scheduler!

Within this app you will be able to list out your daily schedule and come back to it whenever you need to check in throughout the day. You will find each time block will change color depending on wether or not it is in the past, present or future! Simply enter your task in the center field and click the save button to the right, your task list will be stored in your local storage and will still be there even if you close the window. I hope you enjoy this application and it helps you organize your time throughout your busy work days.
